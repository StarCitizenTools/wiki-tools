--- @module Entity/Commodity
--- Commodity kind. Backed by the /api/commodities endpoint (a substance-level
--- entity), distinct from the per-cargo-box /items records. Renders one unified
--- page per substance; the raw and refined records are merged via the enrich
--- hook (see p.enrich). Material family is curated in families.json — the API
--- has no family field.

--- Positive identification: commodity records carry `box_sizes_scu` (the SCU
--- packaging ladder), a field neither items nor vehicles return. Safe on
--- nil / empty / malformed apiData (returns false, never throws).
