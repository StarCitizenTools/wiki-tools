--- @module Entity/Vehicle
--- Vehicle type module. Barebones for now — exposes the vehicles API
--- endpoint so sibling renderers (Availability, Description, etc.) can
--- consume vehicle data through the standard Module:Entity/Data path.
--- Full vehicle infobox treatment (sections, structured data) lands
--- later; this is the minimum needed to route vehicle UUIDs.

local p = {}

--- @type string
p.parent = 'Entity/Base'

--- The vehicles endpoint includes uex_prices and msrp by default, so
--- no `include` param is required for Availability to render.

--- Positive identification: vehicles always carry the `is_vehicle`
--- key at the top level alongside `is_spaceship` and `is_gravlev`.
--- The value is the family flag (`is_vehicle=true` for ground vehicles,
--- `is_spaceship=true` for spaceships, `is_gravlev=true` for hover
--- bikes — a Cutlass Black has `is_vehicle=false, is_spaceship=true`),
--- so we check **presence** rather than value. Items don't have any
--- of these keys.
--- Safe on nil / empty / malformed apiData (returns false, never throws).
